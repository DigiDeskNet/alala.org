						<em>ALALA AMBASSADOR</em><br /><br />
						Kelsang Pawo is the founder of The Gesar Foundation for children. He has 
dedicated his life to his belief that all children of the world 
may 
be equally cherished and therefore, whatever there background or 
culture, find the causes for happiness, success and prosperity. <br /><br />
Pawo wrote the lyrics for the Gesar Foundation world Anthem for children Wish Fulfilling Tree that has been recorded by many musicians across the
globe.
 His humanitarian work began in Ethiopia in 2006 where he built a school
 and formed The Gesar Foundation for the benefit of the world's 
children. Since that date he has continued to inspire the young to 
become ambassadors of Gesar and to create their own projects and 
charities. Several organisations are now active in different parts of 
the world due to his encouragement.<br /><br />
